# 3D Pendulum Automation using Blender

## Overview

This project automates the simulation of a 3D pendulum using Blender, a powerful 3D computer graphics software. The automation is achieved through Blender's built-in scripting capabilities using Python. The project provides an immersive visual representation of a swinging pendulum in a 3D space.

## Project Structure

- `pendulum_animation.blend`: Blender project file containing the 3D scene and automation script.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have Blender installed on your system.

## Running the Project

1. Open the `pendulum_animation.blend` file in Blender.
2. Run the Blender project to visualize the automated 3D pendulum simulation.

## 3D Pendulum Automation

- The Blender project file (`pendulum_animation.blend`) contains the 3D scene setup and automation script.
- The pendulum swings realistically in a 3D space, demonstrating the power of automation in visual simulations.

## Customization

- Adjust parameters within the Blender project file to customize the pendulum's appearance, length, and animation properties.
- Explore Blender's features to enhance the 3D scene and experiment with different pendulum configurations.
